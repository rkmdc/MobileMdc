                India is on the upward spiral when it comes to economic development but it lags behind in social development. MDC Corporation has always aimed to help the disadvantaged and usher in a positive change for the welfare of people from all sections of society. Charity begins at home and so, MDC Foundation is incorporated with an aim to provide help and support to those that do not have the resources to take care of themselves. It aims to reach out to the disabled, pilgrims, the impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, the ailing or injured and the aged.<br/>

                MDC Foundation also allows benefactors to choose which cause they would like to pledge support to and is the first foundation in the world which has the unique facility of tracking how and where their contribution is being utilized.</p>
